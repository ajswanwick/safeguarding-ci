## Aims
 wanted this website to be easy to navigate, with pastel colors that are warm and clear
 This website was designed to be easy to navigate with large menu bars that have links to the content


# Ux

I wanted this project to be be very user friendly and It was designed to predomintley target smaller screens, it was designed in mind to be on smart phones, 

It was targeted to ba handy guide and tool that could be used by individual businesses to promote safeguarding to their teams

I made the entire heading spaces links to the sections so it was very user friendly, i also co-ordinated the headings on each section so the users could identify which section they are on 

# Features to add
 i would like to add some further images and links to externalsites such as NHS for example,

 
# Design 

i wanted to achieve a fairly neutral color scheme that was easy to navigate and identify which sections the user would be on,



 this is a screen grab for a mobile, you can see all the headers stack 

wheras in desktop they are in rows

this is an image of the wireframe model i set out you can see i wanted to make 4 clear sections that was very user friendly

this is how i wanted the sections to re-organise after a section is selected 





# Testing 
All 4 Pages have been tested through W3C with no Errors Showing, 
I do Have a warning for Empty Headers, this is just because i chose to use an Icon for the text, however,

Screen sizes have been checked and across mobile and tablet and laptop the website acts as intended, 

there is some responsiveness issues that need to be ironed out as some breakpoints cause the hero-text to move however this would be fixed in the future.

# Deployment

this is an image for a mobile screen size, nice and centered and following the color scheme for the headers

The website was deployed at an early stage, with no issues, 

# Final Thoughts

the project was challenging, However i am happy with the outcome, i would make some further changes in the future, 
what i would change is to commit smaller sections sooner as i found i would do a large more than one section and then commit a larger peice of work, bu that is a good leraning i have taken. 
There are some things that need to be amended however these would be changed in the future.
